# Guillou-Quisquater (GQ) Signature Scheme

## 📌 Overview
This project provides a Java implementation of the **Guillou-Quisquater (GQ)** identity-based signature scheme. It utilizes the **Bouncy Castle** cryptographic library for secure big integer generation and hashing.

The project includes a benchmarking module to compare the performance of the GQ scheme against the standard RSA algorithm.
